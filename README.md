# Welcome to the README for our Inshort-Clone React app!

This Inshort-Clone React app is a news aggregator app built using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I have used the newapi.org API to fetch the latest news, but unfortunately, the API does not currently provide a description or image URL for each article, which means that we are not able to fetch images for the articles in our app.

Despite this limitation, I have created an app that provides an excellent user experience. The app is built using ReactJS components and utilizes React Router for seamless navigation between pages. We have also implemented state management using Redux, which allows us to easily manage the app's state and data flow.

In addition, I have used modern front-end development practices, such as CSS modules for styling and Axios for API calls. Our codebase is well-organized and follows best practices, making it easy for other developers to understand and contribute to the project.

I are committed to improving our app and are constantly exploring new ways to enhance its functionality and features. We hope you enjoy using our Inshort-Clone React app and look forward to your feedback and contributions to the project!
